Vagrant up fails on initial run 
vagrant up 
vagrant reload

##
I had an issue with installing ansible
The package version (1.5) is so old I couldn't find documentation 
and pip install appeared to be still having this 
issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/31741


Vagrant environment
#vagrant plugin list
#vagrant-share (1.1.8, system)
#vagrant-vbguest (0.13.0)
